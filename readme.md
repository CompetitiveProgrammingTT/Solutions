# Solutions

This is a place where we can place all our solutions (code and explanations) for competitive programming problems.

## Guidelines for Adding Solutions
- Place your code (and any other files) in a folder with your name, username, team name e.g. Jonathan Herbert, foohyfooh or Error 404. The internal structure after that is up to you.
- When possible, document the reasoning for your solutions.
- Don't add code that is not yours or that you don't have permission to use.
- Don't modify another person's code without permission.
